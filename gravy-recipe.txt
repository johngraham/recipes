Makes 2 cups
Prep time: 05 min
Cook time: 15 min
Ingredients:
 •  2 tablespoons reserved pan drippings from roast chicken, beef, or turkey
 •  2 tablespoons all purpose flour
 •  1 cup chicken, turkey or beef stock
 •  1 cup milk
 •  fresh cracked pepper and kosher salt
Instructions:
 1. Reserve the 2 tablespoons of pan drippings in your roasting pan. Place roasting pan on the stove. Heat pan drippings over medium heat. Sprinkle flour over the top and whisk until smooth, cook 1 -2 minutes. Be sure to scrape up any of the brown bits on the bottom of the pan.
 2. Slowly whisk in stock and milk. Reduce heat and simmer for 10-15 minutes or until thickened, whisking occasionally. Gravy should coat the back of a spoon. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
 3. Serve.
A few notes: Don't worry if your gravy appears a bit lumpy, just keep whisking, it will smooth out. If you would like your gravy a little thinner you can add more stock until you reach your desired thickness. If you are making turkey gravy but do not have turkey stock, chicken stock will work just fine. Enjoy!
